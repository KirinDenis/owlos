            // Vertex Array Obejct (VAO) which has the job of keeping track of what parts or what buffers correspond to what data. In this example we want to set our VAO up so that 
            // it tells opengl that we want to interpret 12 bytes as 3 floats and divide the buffer into vertices using that.
            // To do this we generate and bind a VAO (which looks deceptivly similar to creating and binding a VBO, but they are different!).

            // Arguments:
            //   Location of the input variable in the shader. the layout(location = 0) line in the vertex shader explicitly sets it to 0.

            //   The stride; this is how many bytes are between the last element of one vertex and the first element of the next. 3 * sizeof(float) in this case.
            //   The offset; this is how many bytes it should skip to find the first element of the first vertex. 0 as of right now.
